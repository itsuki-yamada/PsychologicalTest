A third of the distance across the Beach, the meadow ends and sand begins. This slopes gradually up for another third of the distance, to the foot of the sand hills, which seem tumbled into their places by some mighty power, sometimes three tiers of them deep, sometimes two, _and sometimes only one._ A third of the distance across the Beach, the meadow ends and sand begins.

The outline of this inner shore is most irregular, curving and bending in and out and back upon itself, making coves and points and creeks and channels, and often pushing out in flats with not water enough on them at low tide to wet your ankles.

## Code & Poetry

    You can also indent
    blocks to display
    code or poetry.

    Indented code/poetry blocks
    can be hard-wrapped.

**Or, wrap your code in three backticks:**

```js
function codeBlocks() {
  return 'Can be inserted';
}
```

### Embedded HTML

With default settings, markdown-wasm allows embedded HTML.

> It has been disabled in this demo for safety reasons, by means of setting `ParseFlags.NO_HTML`.
> Not setting the `NO_HTML` flag allows embedding HTML like this:

<input type=“text” value=“type”></input>

### Block Quotes

> You can insert quotes by
> preceeding each line with `>`.
>
> Blockquotes can also contain line
> breaks.
